career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Ten years connecting Earth observation data to environmental impact - from a carbon sequestration thesis to production ML pipelines to climate AI. Active open-source contributor to GDAL's Zarr v3 driver. Previously built GeoZarr pipelines for ESA's Earth Observation Processing Framework at DevelopmentSeed, and spent five years as Product Architect at Space Intelligence, where I co-designed the technical architecture that scaled from a five-person startup to a sixty-person company shipping global land cover and biomass products.
