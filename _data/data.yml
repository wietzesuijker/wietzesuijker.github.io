  summary: |
    I enjoy creating innovative IT solutions to provide the best earth observation data at scale, aiming to preserve biodiversity and restore the environment. As a product architect, I am responsible for developing machine learning (ML) workflows for land cover and biomass products at Space Intelligence. We expanded from five to over sixty highly educated people during my time at the company. I helped design and develop the technical architecture to scale our products throughout that growth. Previously, I was the technical lead for various satellite-data-driven projects at a Water and IT company.
