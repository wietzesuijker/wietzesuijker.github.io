career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I enjoy creating innovative IT solutions to provide the best earth observation data at scale, aiming to preserve biodiversity and restore the environment. At DevelopmentSeed, I'm working on data pipelines to convert and publish Sentinel data as web-optimized zarr / geozarr for the ESA Earth Observation Processing Framework. Previously, I was a Product Architect at Space Intelligence, developing ML workflows for land cover and biomass products. I helped scale the technical architecture as the team grew from five to over sixty. Prior to that, I was the technical lead on satellite-data projects at a Water and IT firm.
